# JS Applications

In the course "JS Applications", participants learn about HTTP requests, REST services, and working with Baas (backend as a service). The program covers topics such as asynchronous code, including Promises and using async/await, as well as Templating and Routing.

Throughout the program, a dynamic Single Page Application is created, leveraging the techniques covered in previous lectures. This application is assessed to help solidify understanding of the topics covered. Participants also gain an understanding of the architecture of applications and how to structure them properly for maximum efficiency.

By the end of the course, participants have the opportunity to explore different design patterns and their practical guidelines. They are able to create web components using the Web Components standard and build a Webpack environment from scratch. Overall, this program offers a comprehensive learning experience that equips participants with valuable skills to succeed in the world of web development.
